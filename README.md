# sound-scouter-p1

## Description
* The purpose behind this project for all of us first and foremost was to not only learn, but apply the skills we have learned thus far on our coding journey. We chose to build this project due to the relevance that music has in our everyday lives. Streaming your favorite artist, and then being able to order tickets for said artist for upcoming shows is the problem that this app solves. We learned how to work as a team and how to impliment two APIs into a badass website.

## Usage
* Our app can be used to stream music from your favorite artists as well as purchase tickets for an of their upcoming shows if desired.

* WHEN a user searches for an artist on the website
* THEY are given the option of upcoming concerts in a list
* WHEN they click on a concert
* THEY see a photo and details about that show, and a link to purchase tickets
* WHILE they are searching for the dates
* THEY can listen to a YouTube video by the artist
