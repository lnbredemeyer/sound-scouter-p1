## Description
The purpose behind this project for all of us first and foremost was to not only learn, but apply the skills we have learned thus far on our coding journey. We chose to build this project due to the relevance that music has in our everyday lives. Streaming your favorite artist, and then being able to order tickets for said artist for upcoming shows is the problem that this app solves. We learned...(under construction).
